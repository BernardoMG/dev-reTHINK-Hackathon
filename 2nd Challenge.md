# 2nd Challenge

Each team should develop a chat application that uses the `XHyperty` and `GroupChatManager` hyperties that can deployed from the `hysmart.rethink.ptinovacao.pt` catalogue. The `XHyperty` generates a code according to the name of your team that should be passed an input. The `GroupChatManager` hyperty main functionality is to handle text conversations among groups, including:

 * Creation of a new Group Chat with possibility to invite users to join it
 
 * Notification about invitation to join a Group Chat with options to accept or reject

 * Send message to group

 * Receive message from group with identity from sender
 

With this application, users can create chat rooms to exchange messages with each other. Each chat room must be identified by a certain name. The idea is that users can invite others to some specific chat room by indicating their email address. In addition, users can also join some chat room using its identifier. Once inside a chat room, users can exchange messages between them.

To overcome this second challenge, each team should accomplish all the tasks bellow. 
Your feedback is extremely important for us in order to improve reTHINK framework in the future. As such, after complete all the tasks, each team must fill out the page 3 of this [FORM](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeFt56Ura0zkTqg_VX9od_jBZtE3-2mt_urTFvxsoRuQ3uJRw/viewform). 

### Note: If you do not fill out this form, your participation wont be considered! 


## Task 1 (`estimation: 20 minutes`)

To accomplish this first task, your team can continue working on the developed application of the first challenge. The only difference is that now you have to deploy `XHyperty` and `GroupChatManager` hyperties into your application.


## Task 2 (`estimation: 1 hour and 30 minutes`)

`Creation of chat rooms` - Chat rooms must be identified by a certain name. When a chat room is created, the user can also provide a list of emails to invite to the chat room. Alternatively, if some user is at a different domain, this must be provided in order to receive the invitation.

```shell
#Example
GroupChatManager.create(identifier, emails, domains).then(function(chatController) => {
  ...
});
```


## Task 3 (`estimation: 45 minutes`)

`Join chat room` - As soon as the chat room is created, is generated a URL (`DataObject Reporter URL`) that other users should use if they want to join the chat room.

```shell
#Example
GroupChatManager.join(url).then(function(chatController) => {
  ...
});
```


### Task 4 (`estimation: 45 minutes`)

`Exchange of messages` - Inside the chat room, users can easily exchange messages between them.

```shell
#Example
chatController.send(message).then(function(result) => {
  ...
});
```

### Task 5 (`estimation: 20 minutes`)

`Generate a code and broadcast to all the participants` - The generated code depends of the name of each team that should be passed as input. When the code is received should be send to all the participants of the chat room.
