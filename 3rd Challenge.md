# 3rd Challenge

Each team should develop a video conference application that must use an hyperty developed by each team that can be deployed from their local catalogue. With this application, users can make A/V calls between them. To start a call, its only necessary to pass the email address of the other user as input. Alternatively, if some user is at a different domain, this must be provided in order to receive the call. The hyperty should provide functionalities for the establishment and handling of WebRTC A/V connections between two peers (users).
