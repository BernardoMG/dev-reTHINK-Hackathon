# 3rd Challenge

Each team should develop a Chat application that uses the `XHyperty` and `GroupChatManager` hyperties that can deployed from the `hysmart.rethink.ptinovacao.pt` catalogue. The `XHyperty` generates a code according to the name of your team that should be passed an input. The `GroupChatManager` hyperty main functionality is to handle text conversations among groups, including:

 * Creation of a new Group Chat with possibility to invite users to join it
 
 * Notification about invitation to join a Group Chat with options to accept or reject

 * Send message to group

 * Receive message from group with identity from sender
 

In this application, users can create chat rooms to exchange messages with each other. Each chat room must be identified by a certain name. The idea is that users can invite others to some specific chat room by indicating their email address. In addition, users can also join some chat room using its identifier. Once inside a chat room, users can exchange messages between them.
