## Task 1 (`estimation: 20 minutes`)

`Hyperty Development Toolkit` - Currently the toolkit can be used to develop hyperties to be executed in the Browser or in the NodeJS. It is essential to use the toolkit in order to change the `XHyperty` hyperty and complete this challenge.

### Task 1.1: 

`NVM, Node and NPM Installation`

```shell
# NVM Installation
$ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.1/install.sh | bash
# Restart your terminal so NVM can be used

# Node Installation
$ nvm install 6.6.0

# To verify that node and npm was correctly install run:
$ node -v
$ npm -v
```


### Task 1.2 

`reTHINK environment configuration` 

```shell
# clone the toolkit repository:
$ git clone --branch=develop https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-hyperty-toolkit.git

# clone the dev-hyperty repository:
$ git clone --branch=develop https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-hyperty.git

# Note: Ensure that both repositories are cloned inside the same directory 
```

```shell
# Inside the toolkit repository run:
$ npm install -g karma-cli gulp-cli browserify
$ npm install

# Note: It may take a while to install all modules. Hang tight. 
```

```shell
# run the toolkit for browser
$ npm run start:browser

# Note: If you are using MAC OS you may need to run the above command with sudo privileges; 
#       Otherwise with Linux, you can solve this problem with following command. 
#       As result, you do not need sudo privileges.

$ sudo setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep' `which node`

```


Open https://catalogue.localhost/ and accept certificate

Open https://localhost/ and select an Hyperty to run.
