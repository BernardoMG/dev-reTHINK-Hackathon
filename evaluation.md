#	Development Evaluations

The questionnaire included in this section was used to evaluate different aspects of the reTHINK system and its development framework. The main goal with this questionnaire was to collect feedback in reTHINK Beta Tester Event organized on the 27th of May for a limited number of “friendly” developers. This questionnaire was divided into seven sections. One section for teams presentation and background, five sections where each corresponds to a challenge and then a last section for overall evaluation.

The feedback collected from this survey will be used to detect and improve all the weak parts of the framework, making the system more usable. It will also allow measuring the understanding of the most important concepts to improve the documentation and training material.

This event was a success, which allowed to collect a considerable number of answers. The following preliminary conclusions are highlighted:

# Survey - First challenge

This section corresponds to the first challenge of the event that each team had to complete. Basically, the main goal of this first challenge was to provide the first contact with the reTHINK framework. Each team had to developed a simple web application that should use an Hyperty called CodeGeneratorReporter, taking advantage of its features.

1. How easy was to include Hyperties in your application?

[2-1]()

Most relevant comments to the previous question:
  * Without the tutorial and further instructions, we would have taken a lot more time.
  * After launching and installing, it was difficult to understand that authentication was needed and where to find to google button to authenticate

2. How much knowledge about reTHINK did you think is required?

[2-2]()

Most relevant comments to the previous question:
  * You have to have minimal understanding of the framework (conceptually) to be able to understand how to use it.
  * It's needed a good knowledge because is lacking some documentation

3. How much time did you spent reading the documentation? (estimate)
  - 2h
  - 20min (2)
  - 10min
  - 30min
  - 15min (2)
  - 1h

4. Did you manage to easily test and debug your application?
  - Yes (8)
  - No (0)

Most relevant comments to the previous question:
  * The application itself was simple enough that testing and debugging were not a big problem. However, the rethink library logging is maybe a little too verbose.

5. How much time did you spent in the 1st task? (estimate)
